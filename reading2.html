        I found it really interesting to learn about the author, Elan Ullendorff's, perspective on AI usage in terms of how he evaulates the worthiness of content. When he is confronted by content on the internet or content produced by his students he doesn't ask the binary question of whether or not it was produced by AI, but rather is this content an expressive piece of work with a true purpose? Because really the detriment of AI usage is that we risk eliminating our innate expressivity which informs content production. Elan's new Turing text considers content against this expressivity metric because it is the only way we are able to distinguish the value of imitated versus an innate exploration of our human curiosities.
