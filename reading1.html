        I really liked the discussion in this reading about why it may be that restaurant websites can get away with being "bad" because all a restaurant website really needs to convey is the energy and feeling that the physical restaurant space is going to provide. Most websites are not created for this purpose of encouraging a user to shift their engagement with the online realm to the physical realm. More often than not, websites intend for the whole user journey to be completed online. Restaurant websites, on the other hand, aren't necessarily trying to provide an entire curated online experience because their end goal for the user is to have them come to their restaurant and therefore have their true experience in their physical space. A restaurant website is allowed to be imperfect and messy and human because its only job needs to be to entice you to want to know more.
