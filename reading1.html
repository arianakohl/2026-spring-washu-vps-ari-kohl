        I !!!really liked the discussion in this reading about why it may be that restaurant websites can get away with being "bad" because a restaurant website really just needs to convey the energy and feeling that the physical space is going to provide. Most websites aren't created for the purpose of encouraging a user to move from this online space to a physical space at all. Most websites intend for the whole user journey to be completed online. Restaurant websites, on the other hand, aren't trying to provide the whole curated experience online because really their goal for their user is to come to their restaurant and have an experience in a physical space. A restaurant website can be imperfect and messy and human because it just needs to entice you to want to know more.
