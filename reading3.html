        This was a really interesting article to read in the day and age of AI where we don’t exactly know what the future holds regarding this technology. The sentence: “Somaforming vs terraforming, changing ourselves to adapt to a new environment, or changing the environment to adapt to us,” really stuck with me. Both futures seem plausible with foreseeable beneficial and detrimental outcomes. I tend to side with the argument of Matt Webb that the “terraforming” direction is what we should pivot toward. I am of the opinion that as the age of artificial intelligence begins to progress we need to become increasingly more cognizant of creating an intentional separation between us and AI. There is so much value and beauty in innately organic, earthly lifeforms. It is imperative we make a concerted effort to avoid devolving into some dystopian realm of morophed artificial/living beings simply because we are too lazy not to. Webb puts it best: “Computers you can walk into… and walk away from.”
